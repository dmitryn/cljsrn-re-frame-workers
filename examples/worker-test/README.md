# worker-test

An example showing a spinning clojure logo with a computationally intense operation (generating prime numbers).  The normal re-frame version pauses the animation, but the worker performs it in the background.

## Usage: Normal Re-Frame
* `lein clean`
* `npm install`
* `rnpm link react-native-workers`
* `re-natal use-figwheel`
* `lein figwheel ios`
* `react-native run-ios`

## Usage: Re-Frame Workers
* `lein clean`
* `npm install`
* `rnpm link react-native-workers`
* `lein prod-build`
* `react-native run-ios`

## React Native Packaging Problems
* If you have problems, it's probably RN's Packager.  Try closing any open versions, cleaning it and restarting it
* `rm -rf $TMPDIR/react-* && watchman watch-del-all && npm cache clean`
* `npm start`
* Also keep in mind it's super slow.  It takes forever to find dependencies in development, but in production everything runs very fast.
